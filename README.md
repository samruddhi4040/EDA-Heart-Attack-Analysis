I performed EDA on Heart attack analysis & predictions.                                         
The dataset contains rows such as : age,	sex,	cp,	trtbps,	chol,	fbs,	restecg, thalachh,	exng,	oldpeak,	slp,	caa,	thall,	output.                              
The data was checked out on for:                            
1.Understanding the data                      
2.Describing it                   
3.Checking the uniqueness                        
4.Cleaning it                       
5.Checking for any null values                                            
6.Removing redundant values                                     
I also generated various statistical charts based on the data.                            
I've even uploaded the dataset used by me for ease of access.                      
The code was written in Kaggle notebook.
